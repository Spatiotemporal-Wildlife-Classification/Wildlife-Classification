# Metadata Modelling

The metadata modelling process is accomplished through the below scripts:
Please keep in mind the models are trained to form parent node classifiers within the cascading taxonomic structure.

### [Pipeline](../../src/models/meta/pipeline.md)
This file performs data cleaning, transformation, and structuring for use within the metadata models.

### Model Training

### Neural Network

### Random Forest

### XGBoost

### [Decision Tree](../../src/models/meta/decision_tree.md)
The decision tree metadata model training and evaluation process.
Hyperparameter tuning involved determining the optimal decision tree depth for the model.

### AdaBoost

### K-means Silhouette Score Automation
